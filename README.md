## Hi there 👋

I'm Cleo, I"m a third year computer science student based in the UK.

I love programming and have plenty of private projects and I plan to work on some public ones to demonstrate my skills when I have some free time, likely over the summer.

I'm currently working on my dissertation project.

I have experience in the following programming languages:
<ul>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>C/C++</li>
  <li>Haskell</li>
  <li>Javascript</li>
  <li>Lua</li>
</ul>
